And here, our **Action Planner Agent** has already generated a prioritized 3-step intervention plan: Consult cardiologist, monitor BP, low sodium diet."

**45-75s: The Tech Stack**
*Visual: Architecture Diagram / Code Snippet*
"Under the hood, we're running a **FastAPI** backend with **3 CrewAI Agents** working in a swarm. 
We trained 5 **RandomForest models** on **2000 synthetic patient records** generated with Faker, achieving 85% accuracy. It's not just a wrapper; it's real ML."

**75-90s: The Impact & Closing**
